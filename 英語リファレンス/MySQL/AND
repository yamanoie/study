AND

It combines multiple Boolean expressions to filter data.

The AND operator is a logical operator that combines two or more Boolean expressions and returns true only if both expressions evaluate to true. The AND operator returns false if one of the two expressions evaluate to false.



EX)

SELECT 
    customername, 
    country, 
    state
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    country = 'USA' AND state = 'CA';




By using the AND operator, you can combine more than two Boolean expressions.





SELECT    
	customername, 
	country, 
	state, 
	creditlimit
FROM    
	customers
WHERE country = 'USA'
	AND state = 'CA'
	AND creditlimit > 100000;

ORDER BY

To sort the result set


SELECT
   select_list
FROM
   table_name
ORDER BY
   column1 [ASC|DESC],
   column2 [ASC|DESC],
   ...;




   ASC = achending 昇順
   DESC = descending 降順




   By default, the ORDER BY clause ues ASC
   デフォルでは昇順
   だから、ASCはつけてもつけなくてもいい



IF you want to sort the result set by multiple columns



   ORDER BY
   column1,
   column2;





FROM SELECT ORDERBY の順で実行される






ex)

SELECT
	contactLastname,
	contactFirstname
FROM
	customers
ORDER BY
	contactLastname;

contactLastName cloumn in ascending oreder.

LIKE

The LIKE operator is a logical operator that tests whether a string contains a specified pattern or not.

MySQL provides two wildcard characters for constructing patterns: percentage % and underscore _


The percentage ( % ) wildcard matches any string of zero or more characters.
The underscore ( _ ) wildcard matches any single character.

For example, s% matches any string starts with the character s such as sun and six.
The se_ matches any string starts with  se and is followed by any character such as see and sea.

LIKE

The LIKE operator is a logical operator that tests whether a string contains a specified pattern or not.

MySQL provides two wildcard characters for constructing patterns: percentage % and underscore _


The percentage ( % ) wildcard matches any string of zero or more characters.
The underscore ( _ ) wildcard matches any single character.

For example, s% matches any string starts with the character s such as sun and six.
The se_ matches any string starts with  se and is followed by any character such as see and sea.



#LIKE with the percentage (%) wildcard


SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    lastName, 
    firstName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    firstName LIKE 'a%';


 It finds employees whose first names start with a




 SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    lastName, 
    firstName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    lastName LIKE '%on';


It finds employees whose last names end with on


SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    lastName, 
    firstName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    lastname LIKE '%on%';





It finds all employees whose last names contain on



ÔºÉLIKE with underscore( _ ) wildcard 


SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    lastName, 
    firstName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    firstname LIKE 'T_m';



It find employees whose first names start with  T , end with m, and contain any single character between e.g., Tom , Tim, you use the underscore (_) wildcard to construct the pattern





#LIKE operator with the NOT operator


The MySQL allows you to combine the NOT operator with the LIKE operator to find a string that does not match a specific pattern.



SELECT 
    employeeNumber, 
    lastName, 
    firstName
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    lastName NOT LIKE 'B%';

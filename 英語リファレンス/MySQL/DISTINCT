DISTINCT

You may get duplicate rows.
In order to remove these duplicate rows, you use the DISTINCT clause in the SELECT statement.





EX)

First, query the last names of employees from the employees table using the following SELECT statement.

SELECT 
    lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY 
    lastname;



ここでlastnameがダブることがある。
その時にDISTINCTを使う



SELECT 
    DISTINCT lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY 
    lastname;




This statement uses the DISTINCT clause to select unique last names from the employees table



SELECT 
    DISTINCT lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY 
    lastname;



＃DISTINCT with multiple columns

You can use the DISTINCT clause with more than one column.

In this case, MySQL uses the combination of values in these columns to determine the uniqueness of the row in the result set.




SELECT DISTINCT
    state, city
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    state IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    state, 
    city;


stateとcityの組み合わせが同じものがあれば除外する。

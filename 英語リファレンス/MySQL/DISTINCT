DISTINCT

You may get duplicate rows.
In order to remove these duplicate rows, you use the DISTINCT clause in the SELECT statement.





EX)

First, query the last names of employees from the employees table using the following SELECT statement.

SELECT 
    lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY 
    lastname;



ここでlastnameがダブることがある。
その時にDISTINCTを使う



SELECT 
    DISTINCT lastname
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY 
    lastname;

LIMIT

The LIMIT clause is used in the SELECT statement to constrain（規制する） the number of rows to return.

FROM WHERE SELECT ORDERBY LIMIT


#LIMIT to get the highest or lowest rows

SELECT 
    customerNumber, 
    customerName, 
    creditLimit
FROM
    customers
ORDER BY creditLimit DESC
LIMIT 5;



This statement uses the LIMIT clause to get the top five customers who have the highest credit

First, the ORDER BY clause sorts the customers by credits in high to low.
Then, the LIMIT clause returns the first 5 rows.

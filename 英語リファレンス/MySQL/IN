IN


The IN  operator allows you to determine if a specified value matches any value in a set of values or returned by a subquery.

subquery = A MySQL subquery is a query nested within another query such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. In addition, a subquery can be nested inside another subquery.



SELECT 
    officeCode, 
    city, 
    phone, 
    country
FROM
    offices
WHERE
    country IN ('USA' , 'France');



It finds the offices that locate in the U.S. and France,



 You can achieve the same result with the OR operator

 SELECT 
    officeCode, 
    city, 
    phone
FROM
    offices
WHERE
    country = 'USA' OR country = 'France';






#NOT IN


SELECT 
    officeCode, 
    city, 
    phone
FROM
    offices
WHERE
    country NOT IN ('USA' , 'France');
